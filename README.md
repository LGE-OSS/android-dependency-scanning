<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-green" alt="FOSSLight android dependency scanning is released under the Apache-2.0." />
It is a gradle plugin to analyze the android dependencies and generate the report.

## Features
- Run based on Android studio.
- It prints the license names of downloaded libraries based on dependencies in build.gradle.
- It doesn't print the dependencies of test type and 'compileOnly' type.
- It can also print the license of the libraries referenced by the libraries defined in dependencies.


## 🎉 How to Setup

This plugin requires JDK8 (1.8.0 or later).

1. Add the repositories and classpath in the 'build.gradle' file of the project.
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        // Android dependency scanning Plugin
        classpath 'org.fosslight:android-dependency-scanning:1.0.0'
    }
}
```
2. In the 'settings.gradle' file located in the top directory of project, check the module name included in the final build.  
(In case of multi module projects, License scanning is performed for all the modules included in setting.gradle even if only one module specified in setting.gradle is executed after step 3.)  

3. Add the below line in build.gradle file of {module name} directory to apply the plugin.
```
apply plugin: 'org.fosslight'
```
